# Cost Accounting

## Overview

This project is a C# application for performing FIFO-based cost accounting calculations on stock sales. It calculates the following based on user input:

- The remaining number of shares after the sale
- The cost basis per share of the sold shares
- The cost basis per share of the remaining shares after the sale
- The total profit or loss of the sale[README.md](README.md)


The application uses hard-coded data for stock purchases and allows users to specify the number of shares sold and the sale price.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the main source code files organized by layers (e.g., Business Logic, Data Access, and Presentation).
- `tests/` - Holds tests for verifying calculation correctness and application functionality.

## Requirements

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) or later.
